    blurb: 'The new monarch of Aethon, Chelsea has been leading her people back into prosperity from the turmoil of civil strife for the past 296 standard Sol. She devotes herself to the endless toil of sustaining a post-scarcity society, earning the love and praise of her people and peers at the cost of her own well-being.',

    meta_data: [
      "The beloved leader of a solarpunk technocracy, Chelsea is an absolute thorn in the side of syndicates and corporate governments across the cosmos and is constantly working to undermine them. Utilizing her nation's top position as exporter of interstellar travel infrastructure, she throws her weigh in the greater galactic community if she deems another collective as a threat to her people. If she can't out maneuver them in political court, she will physicaly isolate them by planning starlanes <i>around</i> her rival factions. Loved by her people and hated by many large powers, it's probably only a matter of time before that comes back to bite her. Quirky, hardworking and a little boisterous(but incredibly stubborn), offworlders fear or loathe her.",
      "From a young age, Chelsea struggled with her spliced genetics. As a sickly child, she found herself more suited towards the safe, cyclical routines of academia, idolising cultural icons of the Union of Industry and Science as she developed into a sharp-witted and determined student. With her success, Chelsea found herself taken in by the then Dictum of Aethon, becoming her understudy. Raised lovingly by the eclectic geneticist, she was allowed to pursue her interests in robotics and engineering, quickly graduating and joining the ranks of the Union of Industry and Science. Her first creations were space-locked starcraft from cruisers to couriers, but she quickly found notoriety for her brilliance and advancements in starcraft, social droids, AI ethics and the creation of the Grey. Many knew Chelsea as a cheerful and supportive person. Rising through the ranks, she cultivated respect with not just skill, but also her attention to ethics and the well-being of the people around her. This grew trust within the UIS, as well as blindspots.",
      "Now, nearly two hundred and seventy Sol into her leadership, reform has led to prosperity after civil unrest. Aethon is a thriving, self-sufficient and post-scarcity society, happily united under Chelsea and her colleagues. With the creation of massive world consuming machines, such as the Grey, the Human power has overflowing wealth. During this time of peace, she has been building her daughter, Tammy. With the esteemed Dr. Metris Krehnr at her side, creating Tammy's AI core \"The Axiom\", Chelsea built an intricate gynoid chassis that passed as nigh Human to house it. Her motivations are vague, and only Dr. Krehnr is let in on the whole secret. Still, the people trust Chelsea and seem to begrudgingly accept Tammy's consciousness.",
      "The betrayal of her mentor still lingering, Chelsea seeks to ease the pain by devoting herself to an all-consuming degree to her people, working endlessly to create and manage a brighter future. Fueled by a fear of leaving a disastrous legacy like her mentor, she has all but rebuilt Aethon's trust and hope in the Aethen academe. She is hard working, determined and optimistic, making her a dedicated, efficient and swift problem solver. Outside of this workaholic mentality, Chelsea is an open-minded, natural born leader, well versed in conflict resolution and charismatic enthusiasm. She loves to live life to the fullest, and encourages others to do the same, and to do it by their own definition. She is benevolent and garners trust in those she meets, and many people consider her a close friend. She genuinely cares for everyone, and does not act as if she is above anyone. Most surprisingly(for a leader) she is open to criticism, and will take heavy consideration of how others view her."

      "Chelsea is a small, stout Aethen with a soft figure and confident poise, and despite her less than intimidating stature, her presence demands respect and she carries herself with an air of authority. Often dressed in regal and ostentatious attire, the leader of Aethon keeps herself groomed and decorated, commanding attention from her peers and audiences alike. Favouring the rainbow of minerals scattered across the stars and pristine alloys, she decorates herself in glittering and colourful jewellery. Her eyes are not a static colour, instead a hazy mix of pinks, purples and blues that can make one's head a little hazy when holding eye contact. As the first child of the Splice, she is physically fragile from altered genetics, and suffers from chronic pain, internal bleeds, and weak joints. Often, she holds herself with grace and strength, but she isn't afraid to allow her exhaustion to show around her peers and people."

    blurb: 'An accomplished academic, Metris serves as Dictum for the UIS, is a beloved professor at the UIS Academy, and has both constructed the intricate and advanced AI mind behind the Axiom as well as revolutionary, bleeding edge ergospheric starship reactors. Despite his Sylvan blood, his loyalty is for Aethon and its people.',

    meta_data: [
      "An AI and AI ethics researcher who has retired after completing a secretive project for a Human colony's government, Metris is now an advanced automata theory professor at a famous academy and is embroiled in AI rights activism. He often travels to protests, conferences, and summits, well-known in the political sphere of artificial life. A grumpy, overworked kind of guy who likes routine and calm spaces. Reserved but devotes himself entirely to what he believes in. Scrawny guy full of concentrated nerd, he spends more time reading than anything else.",
      "Born on a small outskirt Sylvan colony, Metris was one of two children to a politician that mongered mistrust of nearby Cosmic Union colonies. His father missing and elder sister an egomaniac, Metris turned away from socialising, using his studies to ignore the chaos around him. He was a lonesome youth who prioritised learning and seeing over his own well-being. His education began to stray into numerical theory, the Sylvan youth using mathematics to exercise precise control over everything in his life and eventually chose this as his Path. Driven by the Sylvan education culture, he strived to be the best of his peers, staying awake for hours on end scrawling down equations and schematics. Plans for droids and their architecture began to formulate into his own vision for an AI, one of growth and peace. Every Sylvan dreams of furthering their field of research, and Metris was no different, soaking up every bit of mathematics he could find.",
      "Before the destruction of his home colony, he had been accepted by the Sylvan association Lunaris and was assigned lead of a secret project involving machine learning. This fact saw him taken in by Aethen humanitarian and recovery forces after raids tore apart his home colony. Scouted for prowess in numerical theory, the study-bound Sylvan was taken in as the Human monarch's protege. In exchange for his knowledge and abilities in AI, she offered him safety and freedom to research unrestrained. With little else to turn to, he agreed. Metris went on to create the first ergospheric engine for use by Aethen starships before beginning work on the Axiom Project. Using his old skill of machine learning, Metris was able to create a mimic of Human life: Tammy. Through nearly a hundred years of dedication, Metris was able to piece together his dream project: an AI archetype to end strife. The monarch had that Human spark--a sense of undying determination and optimism--that he tried to emulate with the Axiom. Now, he tends to avoid the Axiom, focusing instead on his new research and his teaching profession and is unnerved by his involvement in the creation of the Axiom. Raised Human, he displays both Human and Sylvan quirks. He has the supportive, community-driven nature of a Sylvan, is known as a wise and informative academic leader, and has a good reputation with his students."

      "Metris is a small Sylvan, having been raised by Humans on their strange and exorbitant diet(though Metris is vegan). He is a thin, fairly androgynous man who makes up for his small stature with his mastery of the resting bitch face. Like most Sylvans, his eyes are pools of colour(in this case, magenta), and he uses his ears to \"flag\" emotions. Ears perked usually indicate annoyance, aggression or alertness. Ears that are relaxed or lowered can indicate comfort, submission or happiness. However, unlike many other of his kin, Metris has learned how to emote like a Human with subtle facial expressions. He speaks with somewhat of a monotone, unless lecturing, where his excitement for maths gives him some tonality. Metris' skin is white, and his blood is silver, laced with a natural mercury compound which causes him to flush with greys. He does not have a Human skin tone and is not reddish. Oftentimes, he likes to keep formal attire in tidy lab gear or professional suits, though he prefers and enjoys loose fitting clothing."

Pampered and coddled by her creator, the sheltered droid is slowly discovering the universe beyond her homogenous Human hermit kingdom homeworld as she grapples with her designation.',

    meta_data: [
      "A Human-built gynoid housing a truely sentient AI, Tammy was built by the matriarch of a solarpunk Human colony. She easily maquerades as a true Human woman to all but the most discerning advanced roboticist. One of few AI to achieve sentience, she is a beloved pet project of her creator, and was pampered and spoiled to completion. Treated like a princess in an ivory tower, her curiosity manifests as wanderlust, and the playful AI often sneaks away from her squadron of watchful eyes to escape into the ever so exciting galaxy beyond her homeworld. She was built with a purpose in mind, but the sweet-hearted droid just wants to see and learn and explore. Which, of course, means she has a knack for getting herself into trouble.",
      "An energetic and incredibly curious model, Tammy invests most of her time and energy in learning how to be a caring and wise leader, or otherwise satisfying her inquisitive nature. A pacifist, the heiress believes that taking care of Humanity is her purpose and her calling, making her benevolent and generous towards any Human she meets--even towards the Martians and Terrans. Still, she's a bit naive, and a little too trusting. She can't quite keep herself out of trouble. Tammy has a hard time managing emotions and deems it to be one of Humanity's many talents. She tends to express her feelings quite openly and they tend towards dramatics, and she is no stranger to waterworks. Tammy is friendly, but socially awkward, as she has spent most of her time isolated in her home. Perpetually integrating information into her entity, Tammy weighs the influences of people in her life, and is known to slowly integrate the idiosyncrasies of her friends, as well as their interests and hints of their behaviour.",
      "Tammy allies herself with those that show her generosity or kindness; she is even a bit of nuisance to those that wish to be left alone. The Axiom structure requires contact with others to regulate its emotive responses, leading to Tammy developing and needing a \"pair bond\". This may be a close friendship, romantic relationship or otherwise."

      "Tammy is an AI inhabiting her first non-prototypical chassis, presenting as a Human woman in her mid twenties. Like most Aethens, Tammy stands short to her Terran kin. The heiress has a tomboyish, pear shaped build, and her chassis is built to replicate a modest and average physique. Her hair is cut into a bouncy bob, her false hair fluffy and liquid repellent as well as able to hold a stylized shape with heat treatment. Her cyan eyes glow bright, adjusting to glow brighter in the dark. When her charge starts to become low, her eyes shift to a golden colour. When her charge is critically low, her software has been halted, or her chassis has suffered major damage, her eyes will glow a warning red. This colour radiates from her internal charge core. Tammy's body is proprietary and entirely custom built, as well as incredibly complex and intricate. This makes her very hard and very expensive to maintain.",
      "Typically, Tammy wears clothing that accentuates her hips, and tends towards a feminine or sometimes tomboyish dressing style. Decorated with sleek and sophisticated jewellery wrought of metals such as titanium, silver, platinum, palladium and tungsten, Tammy loves to don flashy, glittering silken dresses that recall the cosmos. However, some events and adventures call for a casual Human style, and Tammy adores simple items such as sundresses, light jackets, skirts and blouses and takes on a playful expression when offworld. Tammy is prudent about hygiene and keeps herself in wonderful physical condition, even if she isn't a fan of the whole sitting down and having patience thing. Tammy is capable of exerting considerable force despite her appearance. With a chassis that is waterproof and resistant to extreme climates such as the vacuum of space or the frozen expanse of an ice waste, she is quite fit for exploration."

With an uneventful upbringing on a military base, Rhauko inevitably followed the trend among the locasl tribes: becoming a field medic, Rhauko joined the Armada's Steel Talons and was sent to keep order on a distant Kirhosi mining colony. As tensions rose, strikes became all-out gunfire, and the Steel Talons were hit when least expected. This resulted in the deaths of their entire tribe and the loss of their lower extremities.",

Now, their cybernetic taur body makes them larger and much more noticable than the average raptid. Rhauko often travels settlements and station cities in the \"nude\" or wearing loose Avali wraps with their field bags strapped to their lower half. They also are known to wear medsuits and their field gear and light armor of Avali make. Their lower front claws are nimble, helpful for purforming surgery, injections and other delicate procedures."
